## Deliverables

![](Figma-Mockup.png)

After carefully evaluating the mockup, please create a React application that calls this mock JSON (https://gist.githubusercontent.com/telematum/7751eec667033ac8acd244542e464e18/raw/d4710c6fb54224a0bd316ecdc5246633aceefce5/todays.json) and display the data. Save time by not placing images; instead, use colored placeholders.

Once completed, please raise a PR in this repository with the source code and the built result (the 'dist' folder) as well. Ensure to mention your email and name in the PR, as that would allow us to relate your application with the PR
